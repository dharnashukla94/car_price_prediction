# Second Hand Car Price Prediction

In this project I worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. I trasnlated German dataset to english. The aim of this project is to learn how to clean data , try to analyze the included used car listings and predict price of the used car. This dataset contains approximately 37000 instances. 

I used multiple algorithms and tested the performance. The model with better performance is deployed further using flask. Source code is available at car_price.ipynb.
